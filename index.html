	<p>I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia.

	<div class="homeBox"><p><img src="images/wordCloud.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right: .3em;margin-top:.2em;" />My research focuses on the ways digital systems of production, and the cultures that have emerged alongside these systems, are changing the way we create and structure knowledge and creativity. I am especially interested in the culture, history, and political economy of Wikipedia, the phenomenon of Free and Open Source Software, and related experiments with commons-based information production. Select publications on the subject can be found under "publications" below, as well as my complete CV. For recent thoughts and other updates, check out the blog.</p>
<p>Keeping with the "hack not yack" creedo of Free Software, I also sometimes build stuff. I am a member of the development team working on Marca, an open-source web based tool for writing instruction. I also have a variety of other small projects, including Ape-Wits my Wikipedia traffic monitor, listed under "projects" below.</p>
